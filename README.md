# Comprehensive Supermarket Data Exploration using SQL

Embark on a journey of insightful exploration into supermarket data through the adept application of SQL. This project delves into product popularity, customer shopping behaviors, associations, and inventory optimization, employing SQL queries to glean profound insights from the dataset.

## Project Overview

This endeavor is geared towards unveiling intricate patterns and correlations within supermarket data via strategic SQL queries. By dissecting elements such as product popularity and customer shopping patterns, the project aspires to furnish strategic insights for enhancing various facets of supermarket operations.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL Mastery:** Harness the power of SQL for adept data analysis and querying.
- **Robust DBMS:** Employ an apt DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for efficient storage and management of the supermarket dataset.

## DDL (Data Definition Language)

Within the DDL segment, encounter SQL statements meticulously crafted for the creation of indispensable database tables: aisles, departments, product, orders, and order_product. Foreign key constraints are judiciously defined to establish seamless relationships between these tables.

## DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Unveil the intricacies of the DML section, featuring SQL statements meticulously designed to import the provided dataset into corresponding database tables through the nuanced application of the LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE command.

## SQL Queries and Analysis

Embark on a data-driven journey with a suite of insightful SQL queries:

- **Top 10 Products Sales For Each Day of the Week:** Unearth the top 10 products sold for each day of the week, meticulously analyzed based on total sales volume.

- **5 Most Popular Products in Each Aisle from Monday to Friday:** Discern the five most sought-after products in each aisle from Monday to Friday, considering the cumulative sales volume.

- **Top 10 Products with the Highest Reorder Rate:** Ascertain the top 10 products boasting the highest reorder rate, a testament to their frequent demand.

- **Shopperâ€™s Aisle List for Each Order:** Unveil the aisle list for each order by establishing a seamless connection between the order_product and aisles tables.

- **Most Popular Shopping Paths:** Illuminate the most traversed shopping paths by grouping orders based on visited aisles, quantifying the occurrence of each path.

- **Top Pairwise Associations in Products:** Uncover the paramount pairwise associations between products, derived from their co-occurrence within orders, offering insights into potential cross-selling opportunities.
